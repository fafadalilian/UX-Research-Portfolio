# UX-Research-Portfolio

Welcome to my UX Research Portfolio. Here, you'll find detailed case studies of my UX research projects, highlighting my expertise in user research, usability testing, and user-centered design methodologies.

## Projects

### [Project 1: Improving drone missions usability and learnability](Drone-Design-Project/README.md)
  
This project focuses on enhancing the usability and learnability of drone missions by evaluating the impact of various task complexities and training regimens on drone pilot performance. The goal is to develop a comprehensive understanding of how increased payloads, control input behaviors, and cognitive abilities affect task performance, ultimately leading to improved training programs and drone design.

## Objectives
1. **Evaluate Task-Specific Relearning Needs**: Assess how different types of drone missions require varying amounts of relearning when task difficulty increases, such as when payload weight is added.
2. **Design Usability**: Provide recommendations for heuristic evaluations and usability tests across a variety of drone missions to ensure optimal design that can handle a range of operational scenarios.
3. **Training Regimens**: Provide guidance for developing training programs that focus on specific sub-tasks within drone missions, ensuring pilots can efficiently relearn and adapt to new tasks following significant design changes.
4. **Behavioral and Biometric Analysis**: Incorporate control input behaviors and biometric measures (cognitive load, focused attention, vigilance) to objectively assess drone piloting skill acquisition process to enhance learning experiences.
5. **Individual Differences**: Highlight the importance of cognitive abilities in moderating the effectiveness of training, emphasizing the need to consider individual differences in training and usability testing.


### [Project 2: Human collaboration with AI-assisted inspection drones](Drone-Based-AI-assisted-Bridge-Inspection-Project/README.md)
This project provides a deeper understanding of how humans process information and behave when collaborating with drones and AI systems to inspect bridges for damage. It aims to elucidate the intricate dynamics of human-drone-AI interactions, guiding the design and effective implementation of AI-assisted inspection drones. The focus is on the impact of AI on inspection accuracy, the role of drone piloting skills in performance, and the behaviors and cognitive states influencing the detection of bridge damage.

Objectives
1. **Evaluate AI Impact:** Assess how AI assistance affects the overall accuracy of bridge inspections.
2. **Pilot Skill Assessment:** Determine the effect of drone piloting skills on inspection performance. Identify the training requirements for bridge inspectors.
3. **Behavioral and Cognitive Analysis:** Identify behaviors and cognitive states that influence the likelihood of detecting or missing critical information (bridge damage).
