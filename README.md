# UX-Research-Portfolio

Welcome to my UX Research Portfolio. Here, you'll find detailed case studies of my UX research projects, highlighting my expertise in user research, usability testing, and user-centered design methodologies.

## Projects

- [Project 1: Improving drone missions usability and learnability](Drone-Design-Project/README.md)
  ### Overview
This project focuses on enhancing the usability and learnability of drone missions by evaluating the impact of various task complexities and training regimens on drone pilot performance. The goal is to develop a comprehensive understanding of how increased payloads, control input behaviors, and cognitive abilities affect task performance, ultimately leading to improved training programs and drone design.

### Objectives
1. **Evaluate Task-Specific Relearning Needs**: Assess how different types of drone missions require varying amounts of relearning when task difficulty increases, such as when payload weight is added.
2. **Design Usability**: Conduct heuristic evaluations and usability tests across a variety of drone missions to ensure optimal design that can handle a range of operational scenarios.
3. **Training Regimens**: Develop training programs that focus on specific sub-tasks within drone missions, ensuring pilots can efficiently relearn and adapt to new tasks following significant design changes.
4. **Behavioral and Biometric Analysis**: Incorporate control input behaviors and biometric measures (cognitive load, focused attention, vigilance) to create tailored AI-based training paradigms that enhance learning experiences.
5. **Individual Differences**: Highlight the importance of cognitive abilities in moderating the effectiveness of training, emphasizing the need to consider individual differences in training and usability testing.
