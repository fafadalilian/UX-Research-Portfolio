# UX Research Portfolio - AI-Assisted Bridge Inspections

## Project Overview
This project explores the effectiveness of drone_enabled AI-assisted bridge inspections compared to "no AI" inspections. The focus is on understanding how AI assistance impacts overall inspection accuracy, how drone piloting skills influence inspection performance, and which behaviors and cognitive states affect the probability of detecting or missing bridge damage.

## Research Questions
1. **How does AI assistance affect overall inspection accuracy?**
2. **Do drone piloting skills affect inspection performance?**
3. **What behaviors and cognitive states affect the probability of the operator missing or successfully detecting bridge damage?**

## Methodology
The research involved a controlled laboratory experiment simulating drone-based bridge inspections under two conditions: one without AI assistance (no-AI) and another with imperfect AI assistance (AI). Key elements included:

- **Participants**: 45 engineering students (31 male, 14 female) from the University of Iowa, aged 23.53 years on average.
- **Conditions**: 
  - **No-AI Condition**: Participants inspected the bridge for cracks without AI assistance.
  - **AI Condition**: An 80% accurate AI assisted participants by highlighting suspect cracks with green boxes. Participants confirmed or refuted these indications.
- **Data Collection**: Continuous EEG and eye tracking to measure brain activity and eye movements, joystick positions to capture control behavior.
- **Survey**: Participants completed a survey regarding their drone piloting experience and video gaming experience. 
- **Experimental Setup**: Participants flew a drone along a simulated bridge, identifying and marking cracks, and reporting false alarms.


## Experimental Measures
- **EEG Band Powers**: Used to estimate cognitive and emotional states.
- **Eye Tracking**: Measures like fixation count, saccade count, and gaze velocity were used to assess search behavior.
- **Controller Inputs**: Right/left joystick positions were analyzed to compute stabilization and guidance input metrics.

## Analysis
Two main analyses were performed:

1. **Mixed Linear Regression**: To assess the effect of AI assistance and drone experience on inspection accuracy.
2. **Mixed Logistic Regression**: To determine the impact of biometric and behavioral metrics on the probability of missing cracks in each condition.

## Key Findings
### Q1: How does AI assistance affect overall inspection accuracy?

### Q2: Does the amount of control input behavior impact performance?
- **Control Input Behavior**: Impacts performance with task-specific effects.
    - Continuous, inexpensive, non-intrusive data from controller inputs can inform the design of advanced systems and safety overrides.
    - Understanding control responses can help design better training and performance optimization.

### Q3: Are biometric and behavioral measures associated with drone piloting skill acquisition task-specific?
- **Key Measures**: Cognitive load, focused attention, and vigilance significantly influence performance.
    - These measures can be used to develop AI-based training paradigms for engaging and tailored learning experiences.

### Q4: Does cognitive ability moderate the effect of biometric measures on performance?
- **Cognitive Ability**: Moderates the effect of biometric measures on performance.
    - Quantifying individual differences like cognitive ability is crucial for effective training and usability testing.

## Conclusion
This study highlights the importance of integrating AI assistance in bridge inspection training programs and suggests that understanding cognitive load and visual scanning strategies can enhance inspection accuracy. The findings support the development of AI-based training programs and cognitive monitoring systems to optimize inspector performance and safety.

## Future Work
Future studies should validate these findings with professional bridge inspectors in real-world settings. Additionally, exploring more sophisticated statistical models to capture complex, nonlinear interactions between biometric and behavioral measures will be beneficial.
